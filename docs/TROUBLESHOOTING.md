# Troubleshooting

Start with `npm run check` — it validates `.env` and tests both APIs, and its
messages point at the variable to fix.

| Symptom                                                            | Cause / fix                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Invalid configuration: - JIRA_… is required`                      | `.env` missing or incomplete. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the Jira block. On Vercel, add the variables in Project → Settings.                                                  |
| `Jira API 401 verifying Jira credentials`                          | Wrong email/token pair, or the token was revoked. Tokens are per Atlassian account — the email must be that account's.                                                                |
| `Jira API 404 fetching versions for project ABC`                   | `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` is wrong or the account can't Browse the project.                                                                                                                  |
| `JIRA_STORY_POINTS_FIELD … does not exist on this Jira site`       | Run `npm run jira:fields` and copy the id shown.                                                                                                                                      |
| Dashboard loads but every SP is blank                              | Wrong story-points field id (several fields are often named "Story Points"). Check with `npm run jira:fields` and a known ticket.                                                     |
| AI % shows 4000% or 0.4%                                           | `JIRA_AI_CONTRIBUTION_SCALE` is wrong for your field.                                                                                                                                 |
| "No releases found"                                                | The project has no versions, or all are archived/older than the lookback. Create a version in Jira or set `JIRA_RELEASES`.                                                            |
| A release shows "not found in Jira"                                | A name in `JIRA_RELEASES` / `?releases=` doesn't match a version name exactly (names are case-sensitive).                                                                             |
| Cycle time is blank for every ticket                               | `JIRA_IN_PROGRESS_STATUSES` / `JIRA_CODE_REVIEW_STATUSES` don't match your workflow's status names.                                                                                   |
| `GitHub API 401 … Bad credentials`                                 | Token invalid/expired. Fine-grained tokens expire; org tokens may await admin approval.                                                                                               |
| `GitHub API 404` for a repository                                  | Token lacks access to that repo, or `GITHUB_REPOS` has a typo. Private repos need explicit repository access on fine-grained tokens.                                                  |
| "GitHub: could not sync …" banner on the dashboard                 | One repository failed; the rest of the dashboard still rendered. Details are in the server log.                                                                                       |
| "No linked PR found" on tickets that have PRs                      | The PR title/body doesn't follow a recognised convention (see GITHUB_SETUP.md), the PR is older than `GITHUB_LOOKBACK_DAYS`, or it targets a branch excluded by `GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH`. |
| Review timings are blank on old PRs                                | They were cached before the metric existed. `npm run cache:clear` then refresh.                                                                                                       |
| Inline edit fails with `No Jira transition to "X" is available`    | Jira's workflow doesn't allow that status from the current one; the error lists what is allowed.                                                                                      |
| Inline edit fails with `Field "…" cannot be edited`                | Only SP/AP/AI %/summary/status/assignee/issue type are editable by design.                                                                                                            |
| `/api/tickets/...` returns 403                                     | `JIRA_EDITING_ENABLED=false` on this deployment.                                                                                                                                      |
| Vercel returns 503 `Set DASHBOARD_USERNAME and DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | Basic Auth is mandatory on Vercel. Add both variables and redeploy.                                                                                                                   |
| Vercel: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is not set`                         | Create a **private** Blob store in the Vercel project (Storage tab) and connect it; the token is injected automatically.                                                              |
| Vercel cron never refreshes                                        | `CRON_SECRET` unset or differs from the project setting. Hobby plans allow one daily run (see `vercel.json`).                                                                         |
| Refresh button says "timed out"                                    | First run on a large repo exceeds the 120 s window. Run `npm run generate` locally once or lower `GITHUB_LOOKBACK_DAYS`; later runs are incremental.                                  |
| `Port 3000 is already in use; trying 3001`                         | Informational. Set `PORT` to pin a port.                                                                                                                                              |
| Assistant button missing                                           | `AI_API_KEY` unset — the assistant is optional.                                                                                                                                       |
| Assistant: `No chat-capable AI model is available`                 | `AI_MODEL` doesn't exist at `AI_BASE_URL` or doesn't support tool calling.                                                                                                            |
| Tests fail with `Unexpected fetch in test`                         | A test hit the network. All external calls must be mocked with `mockFetch` from `test/helpers/config.js`.                                                                             |

| GitHub + Jira working cache | `npm run cache:clear`                                                                 |
| Generated output            | `rm -rf data/output`                                                                  |
| Review-time logs (local)    | `data/cache/review-logs.json` (Vercel: Blob `dev-metrics-dashboard/review-logs.json`) |
| Vercel snapshot             | Blob `dev-metrics-dashboard/dashboard-bundle.json`; the next refresh replaces it      |

## Getting more detail

- The local server logs every fetch stage with a `[dev-metrics]` prefix.
- `curl localhost:3000/health` shows the last generation time and last error.
- `data/output/bundle.json` (after `npm run generate`) is the exact data the page renders.
